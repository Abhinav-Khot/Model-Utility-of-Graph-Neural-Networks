## Exploring Model Utility of Differentially Private Graph Neural Networks.

This research project was carried out under the guidance of Prof. Anirban Dasgupta. We explore one particular differentially private Graph Neural network : DPAR - proposed by Zhang et.al.

The summary of our findings is concisely presented in the poster present in this repository as `Poster.pdf`.

The experiments on modifying the Personalised PageRank algorithm can be found in the branches of the repository `Project-Course`. Furthermore the experiments involving graph sampling are also found in braches of the same repository.

The experiments on testing the architecture against model inversion attacks can be found in the `Privacy-Attacks-on-GNNs` repository.
